   <h3>   Directions </h3>

 <strong>  Instructions Checklist </strong>
   
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch baking dish cooking spray. </li>
       
<li>   Mix Parmesan cheese, rosemary, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>

<li>    Slice 3 or 4 potatoes using a mandolin on the thinnest setting. Slice remaining potatoes using a slightly thicker setting on the mandolin.</li>
    
<li> Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with thin potato slices, overlapping them to create a layer that is 2 to 3 slices deep. Stand remaining thin slices along the sides of the baking dish so that half an inch sticks over the rim, overlapping them to create a layer that is 4 slices deep.</li>

<li>    Spread 1/3 of the thicker potato slices in the baking dish. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. Repeat once more. Arrange remaining potato slices in the baking dish. Reserve 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture.</li>

<li>    Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour. Pour in milk; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in salt.</li>

<li>    Shift potato slices in a few places with a knife to create wells for the sauce to flow through. Pour sauce evenly over potato slices in the baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. Brush potato edges sticking out of the baking dish with olive oil.</li>

<li>    Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are soft and edges are crusted, 60 to 75 minutes. </li>
